# MD3 TO OBJ #

This is a tool to convert ".md3" Quake / Tremulous files into the ".obj" format.
I built this tool to see if I could do it, but also It was something I needed for a future project.
There were several Windows solutions, but I couldn't find any on the mac (maybe I didn't look hard enough). 

I have tested the files out only with ".md3" termulous files. 
The "-merge" function works as intended, but might not stack up perfectly horizontally.
